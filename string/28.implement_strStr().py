"""
Implement strStr().
Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
Clarification:

What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr(), Java's indexOf() and Python's find().
"""

"""
Thought: 
    Loop through the string and compare needle to the chunk starting at the current position and extending the same length as needle.
